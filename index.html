        Valorant (stylized as VALORANT) is a free-to-play multiplayer tactical first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Microsoft Windows. First teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by official release on June 2, 2020. Development of the game started in 2014.

    <article>
      <ul>Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter and first-person shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world.[5] In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, or spike actions.</ul>

      <ul>
        Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charge. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any actions taken with the spike. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that have a shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player in order to be able to shoot accurately. Different agents allow players to find more ways to plant the Spike and style on enemies with scrappers, strategists, and hunters of every description. It currently offers 14 agents to choose from. They are Brimstone, Phoenix, Sage, Sova, Viper, Cypher, Reyna, Killjoy, Breach, Omen, Jett, Raze, Skye and Yoru.
      </ul>

    <header>Game Modes</header>
    <article>
     <ul>Unrated</ul>
        <li>In the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike. They must deliver and activate the Spike on one of the multiple specified locations (bomb sites). If the attacking team successfully protects the activated Spike for 45 seconds it detonates, destroying everything in a specific area, and they receive a point.[3] If the defending team is able to deactivate the spike, or the 100-second round timer expires without the attacking team activating the spike, the defending team receives a point.[10] If all the members of a team are eliminated before the spike is activated, or if all members of the defending team are eliminated after the spike is activated, the opposing team earns a point.[3] If both teams win 12 rounds, sudden death occurs, in which the winning team of that round wins the match, differing from overtime for competitive matches. Additionally, if after 4 rounds, a team wishes to forfeit that match, they may request a vote to surrender. If the vote is unanimous, the winning team gets all the victory credit for every round needed to bring them to 13, with the forfeiting team receiving losing credit.[11] A team gets only two chances to surrender: one as the attackers and the other as the defenders.</li>
      <ul>Spike Rush</ul>

       <li>In the Spike Rush mode, the match is played as best of 7 rounds - the first team to win 4 rounds wins the match. Players begin the round with all abilities fully charged except their ultimate, which charges twice as fast as in standard games. All players on the attacking team carry a spike, but only one spike may be activated per round. Guns are randomized in every round and every player begins with the same gun. Ultimate point orbs in the standard game are present, but there are multiple power-up orbs instead.[12]</li>
      <ul>Competitive</ul>

       <li>Competitive matches are the same as unranked matches with the addition of a win-based ranking system which assigns a rank to each player after 5 games are played. Before you can play in competitive games, you will need to win 10 unrated matches beforehand.[13] In July 2020, Riot introduced a "win by two" condition for competitive matches, where instead of playing a single sudden death round at 12-12, teams will alternate playing rounds on attack and defense in overtime until a team claims victory by securing a two-match lead. Each overtime round gives players the same amount of money to purchase guns and abilities, as well as approximately half of their ultimate ability charge. After each group of two rounds, players may vote to end the game in a draw, requiring 6 players after the first set, 3 after the second, and thereafter only 1 player to agree to a draw. The competitive ranking system ranges from iron to radiant. Every rank but immortal and radiant has 3 tiers.[14][12]</li>

       <ul>Deathmatch</ul>
        <li>The Deathmatch mode was introduced on August 5, 2020.[15] 14 players enter a 10-minute free-for-all match and the first person to reach 40 kills or the player who has the most kills when time is up wins the match. Players spawn in with a random agent, and all abilities are disabled during the match which indulges pure gunplay.</li>

  <section class="main-section" id="Agents">
    <header>Agents</header>
      <p>Agents are the playable characters in VALORANT, representing an agent of the Valorant Protocol. Each agent serves as a different class with four abilities and has a unique Contract.</p>

      <ul>Jett</ul>
      <li>From Korea comes Jett, an agile fighter who prioritizes movement over everything. Her abilities include a teleportation-based dash and an updraft that lets her reach higher ledges. She also has a smokebomb ability to hinder sightlines and a powerful Bladestorm ultimate that deals moderate-to-heavy damage and remains accurate even while she's moving.Jett is one of the few Agents with a passive ability. Holding the jump key while in the air will allow Jett to slow her descent.Jett's Ultimate allows her to wield several throwing knives that deal moderate damage and kill on headshots. Getting a kill replenishes your daggers and you can choose to throw them one at a time or throw all remaining daggers in a short-ranged burst.</li>
      <ul>Raze</ul>
      <li>Raze loves explosives. With her blunt-force-trauma playstyle, she excels at flushing entrenched enemies and clearing tight spaces with a generous dose of "boom". Raze's playstyle is very aggressive compared to many of the other agents in VALORANT, as most of her abilities are focused on mobility and damage instead of intel gathering or support. She is one of the few agents where most of her abilities are primarily meant to deal damage, namely Paint Shells and Showstopper, and has commonly been criticized by the community for said abilities.</li>
      <ul>Breach</ul>
      <li>Breach fires powerful, targeted kinetic blasts to aggressively clear a path through enemy ground. The damage and disruption he inflicts ensures no fight is ever fair.Breach's main gimmick is the ability to use all of his abilities through the geometry of the map,whether it is through walls, roofs, or terrain. This ability set rewards experienced players for knowing the maps well. His abilities also seem to reward an aggressive playstyle despite most of his abilities being crowd-control based.</li>
      <ul>Omen</ul>
      <li>Omen hunts in the shadows. He renders enemies blind, teleports across the field, then lets paranoia take hold as his foe scrambles to learn where he might strike next. A man with mysterious origins, Omen is focused on hindering the vision of his enemies with things like an orb that strikes those in his sights with nearsightedness and another that bursts to obscure the vision of everyone nearby. He can also teleport a short distance, or use his ultimate to teleport anywhere on the map as a shadow [2].</li>
      <ul>Brimstone</ul>
      <li>Brimstone’s orbital arsenal ensures his squad always has the advantage. His ability to deliver utility precisely and safely make him the unmatched boots-on-the-ground commander. Bimstone is a powerful commander that utilizes incendiary grenades, smokescreen airstrikes, and rapid-fire-inducing stim beacons to damage enemies and buff teammates. His impressive Orbital Strike ultimate summons an enormous laser that destroys anyone who doesn't move out of the radius fast enough [2].</li>
      <ul>Phoenix</ul>
      <li>Phoenix’s star power shines through in his fighting style, igniting the battlefield with his flash and flare. Whether he’s got backup or not, he’s rushing in to fight on his own terms.The fiery Brit can wield the power of flame to essentially reshape the battlefield into how he sees fit. With exploding fireballs that damage enemies and heal him, a vision-blocking wall of fire, and a blinding fire burst, Phoenix is great at manipulating the flow of the match. His ultimate grants him the ability to be reborn if he's killed during its duration, galvanizing him to make bold moves he wouldn't otherwise make.Phoenix can heal himself by standing in his own fire.</li>
      <ul>Sage</ul>
      <li>Sage creates safety for herself and her team wherever she goes. Able to revive fallen friends and stave off forceful assaults, she provides a calm center to a hellish battlefield.The most prominent support character to date hails from China and brings orbs that heal allies, slow enemies, and create barriers out of the ground to impede the flow of a match. Her ultimate ability allows her to resurrect a fallen ally,which is significant in a game with no respawns [2].</li>
      <ul>Sova</ul>
      <li>Sova tracks, finds, and eliminates enemies with ruthless efficiency and precision. His custom bow and incredible scouting abilities ensure that even if you run, you cannot hide [1].An archery expert, he can equip his bow with different bolts that reveal enemy locations or shock nearby adversaries. He can also deploy a recon drone to survey the battlefield, while his ultimate lets him fire three deadly arrow shots through walls [2]. Originally, Sova was supposed to be a female and was supposed to have a visor.</li>
      <ul>Viper</ul>
      <li>Viper deploys an array of poisonous chemical devices to control the battlefield and cripple the enemy’s vision. If the toxins don’t kill her prey, her mind games surely will [2].A predator that deals in poison and chemical warfare. She has exploding projectiles that spill acid on the battlefield, as well as a poison-gas emitter, and a toxic gas screen to prevent passage. Her ultimate emits a toxic cloud that conceals her location and can highlight enemies who wander into it [3].</li>
      <ul>Cypher</ul>
      <li>The Moroccan information broker, Cypher is a one-man surveillance network who keeps tabs on the enemy’s every move. No secret is safe. No maneuver goes unseen. Cypher is always watching [1].If intel is your thing, Cypher might be your Agent. This Moroccan surveillance Agent has abilities that trap and reveal the locations of enemies that get stuck in them, as well as an actual spycam he can place on the map to watch the action from afar. His ultimate extracts information from a fresh enemy corpse to temporarily reveal the location of remaining players on the opposing team [2].</li>
      <ul>Reyna</ul>
      <li>Forged in the heart of Mexico, Reyna dominates single combat, popping off with each kill she scores. Her capability is only limited by her raw skill, making her highly dependent on performance.[1] Reyna has the passive ability of Soul Harvest, enemies killed by Reyna leave behind Soul Orbs that last 3 seconds. Soul Harvest abilities consist of Devour and Dismiss which have a shared usage pool.</li>
      <ul>Killjoy</ul>
      <li>The genius of Germany, Killjoy secures the battlefield with ease using her arsenal of inventions. If the damage from her gear doesn't stop her enemies, her robots debuff will help make short work of them.</li>
      <ul>Skye</ul>
      <li>Hailing from Australia, Skye and her band of beasts trail-blaze the way through hostile territory. With her creations hampering the enemy, and her power to heal others, the team is strongest and safest by Skye's side.</li>
      <ul>Yoru</ul>
      <li>"Japanese native Yoru rips holes straight through reality to infiltrate enemy lines unseen. Using deception and aggression in equal measure, he gets the drop on each target before they know where to look."</li>

        Valorant was developed and published by Riot Games, who have previously developed League of Legends.[20][5] Development started in 2014, within their research and development division.[2] Joe Ziegler, Valorant's game director, is credited with the initial idea of Valorant while formulating potential games with other Riot developers.[2] David Nottingham is the creative director for Valorant.[2] Trevor Romleski, former League of Legends's designer and Salvatore Garozzo, former professional player and map designer for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are game designers for Valorant.[21] Moby Francke, former Valve developer, who has been art and character designer for Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2, is the art director.[22][23]Valorant was built with two main focuses in mind: making tactical shooters and e-sports more accessible to new players, and creating a game that would foster an intense competitive scene, while solving many of the pain points that pro players from games in the genre had.[24][25][26] Games aimed at large, active communities and playerbases, typically free-to-play games like Fortnite or Riot's own League of Legends, tend to put an emphasis on a wider array of system performance improvements and game stability rather than newer technologies or more cutting-edge graphics as a way of making sure they're as accessible as possible. In interviews leading up to the game's launch, game director Joe Ziegler and producer Anna Donlon said that Valorant was built for people playing their first tactical shooter just as much as it was to professional players, and that accessibility of the game was a huge priority.[25] Professional tactical shooter players, largely playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, had complained for years while Valorant was in development about the CS:GO's competitive limitations in not meeting it's potential for system and netcode optimizations, round-trip delay, and hit registration.[27][28] These problems were only exacerbated by CS:GO developer Valve's trademark lack of communication with their community. These problems are largely due to Counter-Strike's aging underpinnings, as it was built on the same Source engine that Half-Life 2 released with in 2004. To make their own space within the tactical-shooter genre and bring a more modern and competitive game to the table, team set out to solve these problems when developing the game.[25]In an effort to find an effective solution towards meeting the priorities of game stability and performance alongside creating a robust, competitive and responsive experience online, Riot chose to build Valorant using Unreal Engine 4.[29] This allowed the development team to focus on gameplay and optimizations rather than spending valuable time on core systems that Unreal already came with.[29][30] To meet the goal of a lower performance barrier so more people could play Valorant, the team set notably low minimum and recommended hardware requirements for the game. In order to reach 30 frames per second on these small requirements, the game's engineering team, led by Marcus Reid, who previously worked on Gears of War 4, had to make several modifications to the engine. These modifications included editing the renderer using the engine's mobile rendering path as base, or reworking the game's lighting systems to fit the static lighting that tactical shooters often require, as to not interfere with gameplay.[29] Unreal's modern underpinnings also helped to solve many of the issues that Riot set out to solve from other games in the genre, and additional modifications helped to meet the game's other goal of creating a suitable competitive environment, including optimizing server performance by disabling character animations in non-combat situations and removing unnecessary evaluations in the hit registration process.[31][25][29] During development, Riot Games made promises to work towards a ping of less than 35 milliseconds for at least 70% of the game's players.[32] To accomplish this, Riot promised servers in or near most major cities in the world, as well as working with internet service providers to set up dedicated connections to those servers.[32] Due to the increase in internet traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic, Riot has had trouble optimizing connections and ping to their promised levels.

      <ul>Valorant has been compared to Valve's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, with both games having two teams of five attempting to plant a bomb,[4] and Blizzard Entertainment's class-based shooter Overwatch, as both games have multiple classes catering to various playstyles.Austen Goslin of Polygon praised the beta of Valorant describing it as refined and "one of the most fun tactical shooters I've played".[2] On the first day of its beta launch, Valorant amassed the second most concurrent viewers for any game ever on Twitch, with 1.73 million viewers tuning in across dozens of streams. Only another title from Riot Games, League of Legends, has had more concurrent viewers, when 1.74 million watched the 2019 World Championship final.It was nominated for Best Esports Game, Best Multiplayer and Best Community Support at The Game Awards 2020.</ul>

      <li>Anti-cheat software controversy</li>
      <ul>The game has been criticized for its anti-cheat software, Vanguard, as it was revealed to run on a kernel driver, which allows access to the computer system.[47] OSNews expressed concern that Riot Games and its owner, Chinese technology conglomerate Tencent, could spy on players and that the kernel driver could be potentially exploited by third parties.[47] However, Riot Games stated that the driver does not send any information back to them, and launched a bug bounty program to offer rewards for reports that demonstrate vulnerabilities with the software.[48][49]</ul>
